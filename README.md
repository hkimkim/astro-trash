## Description 
A web browser game that informs players about the dangers of space junk.

## Backstory
A space junk is so close to hitting the International Space Station. You, the astronaut, have to hover over to the space ship that came to transport you to a near by Space Station. Be careful of the other space junk between the International Space Station and the space ship!

## Problem

The Earth has too much space debris floating around its orbit. There are approximatly 6,542 satellites that are currently orbiting the Earth, but half of them are doing nothing. To make things worse, when they collide, they get broken down into smaller pieces, creating more junk that clutter the earth's orbit. Space Junk is becoming microplastics of the space.

The **dangers of space debris** is that it may collide with a functioning satellite or even the International Space Station and create unwanted damage.
In March 2021, a chinese satellite got struck by a space debris from a Russion rocket that was launched in 1996 and broke down, becoming another space debris itself.

With the increaseing number of launches of satellite and rockets in recent years (over 1,200 satellites were launched just in 2020), more space debris is expected, which means there are higher risk of unwanted space collusions that could cost a lot of resources.
